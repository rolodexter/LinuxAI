# Scope and Objectives for LinuxAI

## Project Scope
The LinuxAI project aims to build a custom Linux distribution that integrates AI-powered capabilities, such as:
- Natural language processing for file system search using large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA.
- Middleware to enable seamless interaction between the operating system and AI models.
- Optimized environment for running AI models locally on a variety of hardware configurations.

## Objectives
1. **Research and Define Architecture**:
   - Choose a lightweight Linux base distribution (e.g., Debian Minimal, Arch Linux).
   - Design a modular architecture to support AI and file indexing features.

2. **AI Integration**:
   - Incorporate LLMs for semantic file search and knowledge-base-style queries.
   - Develop middleware to interface between the AI and the file system.

3. **User Interface Enhancements**:
   - Customize a file explorer (e.g., Nautilus, Dolphin) to include AI-driven search.
   - Build a command-line interface (CLI) for advanced queries.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize the system to support local AI inference, including quantization and offloading strategies.
   - Ensure efficient hardware utilization for both high-end GPUs and lower-resource devices.

5. **System Security**:
   - Implement encryption for indexed data to protect sensitive information.
   - Harden the Linux kernel and OS components to mitigate vulnerabilities.

6. **Community Collaboration**:
   - Develop documentation for contributors and users.
   - Foster a community-driven development approach.

## Deliverables
- A fully functional custom Linux distribution with AI-powered features.
- A bootable ISO image for installation and testing.
- Documentation for setup, usage, and contribution.

## Success Metrics
- Seamless AI query integration into the file system.
- Efficient performance on both high-end and resource-constrained hardware.
- Positive feedback and contributions from the open-source community.
