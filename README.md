# LinuxAI

LinuxAI is a custom Linux distribution designed to seamlessly integrate AI-powered capabilities, enabling users to leverage advanced language models like Meta’s LLaMA for natural language queries and intelligent file system management. This project aims to create a powerful, AI-enhanced operating system for developers, researchers, and tech enthusiasts.

## **Features**
- **AI-Enhanced Search**:
  - Leverage large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA to perform natural language queries on your file system.
  - Retrieve documents, code snippets, and files based on semantic meaning, not just file names.
  
- **Custom File Explorer**:
  - Enhanced UI for seamless interaction with AI-powered search capabilities.
  - Integration with middleware to link the LLM with your indexed file system.

- **Efficient Local AI Deployment**:
  - Optimized for local inference with GPU/CPU acceleration.
  - Support for model quantization (e.g., INT8/INT4) to reduce memory usage.

- **Lightweight and Modular**:
  - Built on a minimal Linux distribution for maximum performance.
  - Modular architecture allowing customization and extensibility.

## **Getting Started**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rolodexter/LinuxAI.git
   cd LinuxAI
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Run the setup script to install dependencies and configure the project:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/setup.sh
     ```

3. **Build the ISO**:
   - Create a bootable LinuxAI ISO for testing:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/build_iso.sh
     ```

4. **Deploy AI Features**:
   - Deploy and configure LLaMA or another AI model:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/deploy_ai.sh
     ```

## **Roadmap**
- **Phase 1**: Planning and Research (Current Phase)
  - Research lightweight Linux distributions and LLM integration.
  - Define project scope and system architecture.

- **Phase 2**: Core OS Development
  - Build and configure the Linux kernel.
  - Set up the file system and minimal OS environment.

- **Phase 3**: AI Integration
  - Integrate LLaMA for natural language search.
  - Develop middleware and connect it to the file system.

- **Phase 4**: Optimization and Testing
  - Optimize for local inference and low-resource systems.
  - Test system performance and security.

- **Phase 5**: Distribution
  - Package the OS into a bootable ISO.
  - Provide installation and usage guides.
